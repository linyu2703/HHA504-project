# Final Project: Cloud Integration Mini-Capstone

## Project Overview
This project contains the design documents for a Remote Patient Monitoring (RPM) Data Pipeline, a small, realistic healthcare cloud based solution. The architecture is designed to securely retrieve data from patient wearables, process it using serverless compute (services like Azure and GCP), and present aggregated metrics and alerts to clinical staff through (Tableau and PostgreSQL).

## Deliverables
* `use_case.md`: Defines the healthcare problem, the users, the data sources, and the high-level workflow.
* `architecture_diagram.png`: A visual representation of the architecture components and data flow.
* `architecture_plan.md`: Detailed plan including the service mapping (GCP services), a data flow narrative, security/governance basics, and cost and operational management considerations.
* `reflection.md`: Thoughts on the design, including points of confidence/uncertainty, alternative architectures, and future implementations.
* `readme.md`: A detailed overview of the entire project with instructions.
